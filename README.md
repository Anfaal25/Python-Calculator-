# Python Calculator Application

## Introduction
Welcome to my Calculator Application project! This terminal-based calculator is designed to evaluate mathematical expressions containing three values and two operators. 
It takes user input and provides the result of the expression following the correct order of operations.

## Features
- Accepts three integer values and two operators as input.
- Supports a variety of operator combinations including +, -, *, and /.
- Handles scenarios involving division by zero and displays appropriate error messages.
- Outputs the user's input expression and the final calculated result.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
- git clone [https://github.com/Anfaal25/python-calculator-.git](https://github.com/Anfaal25/Python-Calculator-.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
- cd Python-Calculator-


3. Run the `calculator.py` script using Python:
- python calculator.py


4. Follow the prompts to input your values and operators.

## Examples
1. Input:
- Please enter your first value = 10
- Please enter your first operator = +
- Please enter your second value = 5
- Please enter your second operator = *
- Please enter your third value = 2


Output:
- Your final expression: 10 + 5 * 2
- Your final answer = 20



2. Input:
- Please enter your first value = 8
- Please enter your first operator = -
- Please enter your second value = 4
- Please enter your second operator = /
- Please enter your third value = 0



Output:
- Your final expression: 8 - 4 / 0
- Math Error



## Conclusion
